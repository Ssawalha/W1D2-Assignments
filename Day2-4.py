"""
McNugget Numbers
==================

In the 1980s, while eating McDonald's with his son, mathematician Henri Picciotto reasoned [McNugget Numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin_problem#McNugget_numbers).

At McDonaldsâ€™ Restaurants at the time, Chicken McNugget meals were available in sizes of 6 McNuggets, 9 McNuggets, or 20 McNuggets. 

A number is a McNugget number if it can be the sum of the number of McNuggets purchased in an order before eating any of them.

Some Examples:

		20 + 6 == 26
		9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 == 45
		20 + 9 + 6 == 35
		...etc

###Task 1

Determine all numbers that are not McNugget numbers using 1980s order sizes - `6`, `9` and `20`.

###McNugget 2015 Redux

Determine all numbers that are not McNugget numbers using today's order sizes - `4`, `6`, `10`, `20` and `40`.
